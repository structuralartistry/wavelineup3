    System built around ease of starting easily to use without additional setup
    Around the idea that it from day one will allow you to use with PM's as they come in for entrainment
    Lets imagine you have nothing set up in the system and you want to log a PM's Visit
    (Create New PM)
    Once new PM created you are automatically brought to the Visit view of the Practice Room
    The Practice Room is where you log Visits, Set Travel Card info, and can access Visit List (History)

        Set Travel Card
        See Gateways on the Visit Mini-Travel Card
        See Highlighted Gateways on the Visit Mini-Travel Card
        Pull up past Visits on Visit List
      Finding Practice Members
        Of course it is more interesting the more information you have entered on the TC, so lets pull up a PM with a complete TC
        On their Visit view you see all their TC info on the Mini Travel Card
      Lineup Selector
        Another feature we have added is to make it easy for you to move between PM's while you treat
        For this we have the Lineup selector
        The Lineup selector will hold all the PM's you have accessed within the last 30 minutes. 
        Allowing you to easily toggle between the recently accessed PM's.
        After 30 minutes they fall off the list, as we assume that an average entrainment would last 15-30 minutes

Feedback/Support 
  You can easily send comments or requests for help directly from the application.

Edit Practice
  You can easily Edit your User and Practice. If you are the user who set up the Practice you may cancel it at any time.
  We will not go into all the settings here, but one is especially important.
  One of the principals we believe in is that you should own your data and feel free at anytime to leave the system should you find something else which suits your needs better.
  For that reason, at any time (and we recommend that you regularly use this feature to back up your data)
