<%= fading_flash_notice %>
// load the practice room page... easier to just load the page than try to update everything with ajax (have to update 3 different partials)... could do later
// this also allows the pm selector 'Find' to get updated on the new page load vs also doing that in ajax
window.location.href='/practice_room/<%= @practice_member.id %>/visit';
